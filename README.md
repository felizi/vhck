## Inspiration
The iniciative is from Mike Moll and it's about creating an entire community of groups of people that live in the same building to share a social life and common feelings. We loved it at the very beginning. We want to change the world in a good way, heating up the cold part of the world. We have a dream where people care about each other, where they left their differences and embrace the human being. We think that technology is amazing but somehow tears us apart, but the same technology can promote the oposite. So we are a geek group-of-4 that shares
passion for tech and a deeper desire to be meaningful for our families, friends, society and world.

## What it does
The Neighbors is a place where anyone can create or join the community of the building they live, so they can create events, warn about any occurrence, talk to each other and to their landlords and promote a better living

## How we built it
We took all the 48 hours of the challenge and splitted in three big parts.The first 6 hours we spent planning it. Our roles were set before, so **Samuel** was responsible of **designing the product**. **Helder** was responsible for the front-end, so he used some new tools from the market, such as **ionic** and **angularjs**. **Daniel** and **Augusto** were responsible for thinking about the back-end and the architecture of our system.

## Challenges we ran into
To hear about a problem and define the DDD architecture in a single day is quite challenging. Put it together to the fact we've never developed for mobile and we have the definition of chaos. But we like it ;) We faced situations of very complex definition and the issue of time kind of turned it into a super sayajin level 4. Also we've heard we've beaten the last guinness record of liters of coffee consumed in a single day.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
We are very proud of what we achieved. We are friends for a couple years but we've never done something like this together. Our coletive sense and team work was incredible. So we are planning to keep this group to attack our own demands. Also, we've never done nothing about mobile devices before and it was very challenging, so we stucked sometimes in basal problems but the knowledge we've got was enough. Most of all, we are proud of finishing it before throwing ourselves by the window.

## What we learned
We learned that our PCs should never know when we are in a hurry. :P Also developing for mobile is super cool and has it's own particularities. We learned that four PCs, four cellphones and some routers all together in the same room might get our wireless mouses quite freaking-crazy and we learned that our self-controls about it need some attention. 

## What's next for Neighbors social app
We've heard about Mike Moll idea of creating a social network for people that live in the same building, so they can interact with each other using the app, but we turned it into an app that doesn't wait for the user to use it but suggest the interactions between users. For now the social network is being created, but in next episodes scenes you might see some AI, minering throw all the data storaged and suggesting when somebody isn't being that social to interacte with someone, or to a group to make a party. Think about the possibilities... It might be amazing!
